# RaceRegconitionVGG16
Race Regconition using Pretrained model VGG16.

#1. Materials:
- Paper in this repo: (Race Recognition Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks)[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZKVwGre-my2DE6jbwdHoN3UvUgLsNcUP?fbclid=IwAR07NFXYvAsKaG8giMuu73Dhd10mXmAr4ntv2ZA8h1bSs1P6NSOX2FJ-1e8]

#2. Model:
- Pretrained VGG16 from Imagenet

#3. Implement and Result: 
- I have experimentede this paper with Tensorflow and Keras on Google Colab. 
- I would like to do this paper to others pretrained models like ResNet and InceptionNet, ...

#4. Result:
- 73.29% with VGG16.
